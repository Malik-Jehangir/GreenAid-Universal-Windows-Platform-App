# GreenAid- A Universal Windows Platform App

‘GreenAid’ is a mobile based application that helps to design user’s surroundings; with plants/flowers. He/
she would simply click a photo, select favorite plants/ flowers from the in-app gallery, drag them over a
desired location within the clicked photo, and once this is done; the user will be able to select the nearest
flower shop or nursery from his current location that the app displays automatically when the user completes
designing, to place the designed order. This time saving app will encourage many users to create an eco-
friendly environment at their work / living spaces, without many efforts. Any size of space, big or small,
window or a doorway, it doesn’t matter wherever you want to place the plants. Time saving? Absolutely yes.
Surprisingly, this app provides a means that won’t require it’s user to take out time to visit flower shop firm
and buy what he/ she needs, in short, Everything you need, is in your palm, just a click away.
